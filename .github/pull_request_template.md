PR Title format.

This repository follows semantic versioning convention, therefore each PR title/commit message must follow convention: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
   `type` is defining if release will be triggering after merging submitted changes, details in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
    Most common types are:
    * `feat`      - for new features, not a new feature for build script
    * `fix`       - for bug fixes or improvements, not a fix for build script
    * `chore`     - changes not related to production code
    * `docs`      - changes related to documentation
    * `style`     - formatting, missing semi colons, linting fix etc; no significant production code changes
    * `test`      - adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change
    * `refactor`  - refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable or function name, there should not be any significant production code changes

Examples:
  feat(ha): support faster node failure detection 
  fix(replica): remove previous replica with same ip
  chore(build): upgrade the go version to 1.18
  docs(user): add monitoring related user guides
  refactor(provisoining): make use of the new context api
  test(ut): handling volume deletion failures
